# USIU AI-Powered Chatbot

This repository contains the implementation of an AI-powered chatbot designed to handle a wide range of user queries with contextual understanding and intelligent response generation. The chatbot is trained using a paraphrased question-answer dataset and is tailored for academic and general informational interactions.

## Overview

The chatbot project leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to provide accurate, real-time responses to user inputs. The system is particularly optimized to manage paraphrased or variably worded questions, enhancing its utility in dynamic conversational settings.

## Dataset

* **File Name:** `paraphrased_questions.csv`
* **Description:** This dataset comprises a collection of question-answer pairs, including multiple paraphrased versions of each question to improve the modelâ€™s ability to understand diverse query formulations.
